####Getting Started with Server
1. Clone the app `git clone https://github.com/bbrookfield/node-alexa-server`
2. Install modules `npm install`
3. Run the application `PORT=9000 node app.js`
4. If no errors occur then you can begin [adding modules](#adding-modules) or [create your own module](#create-your-own-module)

##How this application works
The alexa-server application is an [express](http://expressjs.com/) webserver that routes Amazon requests to various app modules located in your **app_modules** directory. Each of these modules creates a global function that is called by the express router based on the URL path.

For example a request to `https://[your server URL]/thermostat` would route the request to **global.thermostat**

##Adding modules
1. To add modules to your server, you need to create an `app_modules` directory in the root directory
2. Then clone the module into your `app_modules` directory
  * *example:* `git clone https://github.com/bbrookfield/alexa-radiothermostat`

##Compatible modules (If you create one, let me know and I will add it to the list)

2. [alexa-directTV](https://github.com/bbrookfield/alexa-directTV) - For changing channels on your DirectTV
3. [alexa-radiothermostat](https://github.com/bbrookfield/alexa-radiothermostat) - For getting the current temperature and changing the temperature on your [Radio Thermostat](http://www.radiothermostat.com/)
